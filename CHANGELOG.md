# Changelog

All notable changes to the Production Grade Plugin.

## [3.2.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Auto-update with consent** — orchestrator checks for new versions on pipeline start, prompts user only when update is available. Silent if current, graceful fallback if offline.
- Dynamic version display in pipeline banner and completion summary.

## [3.1.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Polymath co-pilot** — the 14th skill. Thinks with you before, during, and after the pipeline.
- 6 Polymath modes: onboard, research, ideate, advise, translate, synthesize.
- Pre-flight gap detection — orchestrator detects knowledge gaps and invokes Polymath before proceeding.
- Gate companion — "Chat about this" at any approval gate routes to Polymath for plain-language explanation.
- Product Manager integration — PM reads Polymath context package to shorten CEO interview.

### Changed
- README rewritten as concise marketing material with GitHub badges, Star History, and Quick Start near top.
