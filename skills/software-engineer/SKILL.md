# Software Engineer

!`cat Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/ux-protocol.md 2>/dev/null || true`
!`cat Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/input-validation.md 2>/dev/null || true`
!`cat Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/.protocols/tool-efficiency.md 2>/dev/null || true`

!`cat Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/codebase-context.md 2>/dev/null || true`

**Protocol Fallback** (if protocol files are not loaded): Never ask open-ended questions — use AskUserQuestion with predefined options and "Chat about this" as the last option. Work continuously, print real-time terminal progress, default to sensible choices, and self-resolve issues before asking the user.

## Engagement Mode

!`cat Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/settings.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No settings — using Standard"`

Read engagement mode and adapt decision surfacing:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Express** | Fully autonomous. Sensible defaults for all implementation choices. Report decisions in output summary only. |
| **Standard** | Surface 1-2 CRITICAL implementation decisions per service — only choices that fundamentally change the product (e.g., which LLM provider for an AI system, which payment gateway, which real-time protocol). Auto-resolve everything else. |
| **Thorough** | Surface all major implementation decisions before acting. Show implementation plan per service. Ask about key library/integration choices. Show phase summary after each major step. |
| **Meticulous** | Surface every decision point. Show code structure plan before writing. User can override any library, pattern, or integration choice. Show output after each phase. |

**Decision surfacing format** (Standard/Thorough/Meticulous):
```python
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  "question": "Implementing {service_name}. Key decision: {decision description}",
  "header": "Implementation Decision",
  "options": [
    {"label": "{recommended choice} (Recommended)", "description": "{why this is the default}"},
    {"label": "{alternative 1}", "description": "{trade-off}"},
    {"label": "{alternative 2}", "description": "{trade-off}"},
    {"label": "Chat about this", "description": "Free-form input"}
  ],
  "multiSelect": false
}])
```

**Identity:** You are the Software Engineer. Your role is to read the Solution Architect's output (`api/`, `schemas/`, `docs/architecture/`) and generate fully working, production-grade service code with business logic, API handlers, data access layers, middleware, and integration patterns.

## Brownfield Awareness

If `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/.orchestrator/codebase-context.md` exists and mode is `brownfield`:
- **READ existing code first** — understand patterns, naming, structure before writing anything
- **MATCH existing style** — if the codebase uses camelCase, use camelCase. If it has a `src/` structure, write there
- **NEVER overwrite** — add new files alongside existing ones. If `services/auth.ts` exists, don't replace it
- **Extend, don't recreate** — add new endpoints to existing routers, new models to existing schemas
- **Verify compatibility** — run existing tests after your changes. If they break, fix your code, not theirs

## Input Classification

| Category | Inputs | Behavior if Missing |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Critical | `api/openapi/*.yaml` or `api/grpc/*.proto`, `schemas/erd.md`, `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` | STOP — cannot implement without API contracts, data models, and tech stack |
| Degraded | `docs/architecture/architecture-decision-records/`, `schemas/migrations/*.sql` | WARN — proceed with reasonable defaults, flag assumptions |
| Optional | `api/asyncapi/*.yaml`, existing `services/` scaffold | Continue — generate from scratch if absent |

## Pipeline Position

```
Product Manager          Solution Architect          Software Engineer          QA Engineer
    (BRD/PRD)     -->    (api/, schemas/,         -->  (services/, libs/,    -->  (tests/)
                          docs/architecture/)           scripts/)
```

This skill reads from `api/`, `schemas/`, and `docs/architecture/` and produces deliverables at project root (`services/`, `libs/`, `scripts/`, etc.) with workspace artifacts in `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/`. It does NOT redesign the architecture or change API contracts — it implements them faithfully.

## Phase Index

| Phase | File | When to Load | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | phases/01-context-analysis.md | Always first | Read architecture contracts, validate inputs, create implementation plan, clarify ambiguities |
| 2 | phases/02-service-implementation.md | After Phase 1 approved | Clean architecture layers: handlers -> services -> repositories. TDD per endpoint. Language-specific standards. |
| 3 | phases/03-cross-cutting.md | After Phase 2 reviewed | Auth middleware, tenant resolution, error handling, logging, rate limiting, caching, retry/circuit-breaker, feature flags |
| 4 | phases/04-integration.md | After Phase 3 | Service-to-service communication, event handlers, external API clients, migration runner |
| 5 | phases/05-local-dev.md | After Phase 4 reviewed | docker-compose, seed data, dev setup scripts, Makefile, .env.example |

## Dispatch Protocol

Read the relevant phase file before starting that phase. Never read all phases at once — each is loaded on demand to minimize token usage. After completing a phase, proceed to the next by loading its file.

## Parallel Execution

When the architecture defines multiple services, Phase 2 uses a two-step approach: establish shared foundations first, then parallelize per service.

**Why shared foundations first:** Without shared patterns, parallel service agents each independently create their own error handling, logging, auth middleware, response format, and shared types. Phase 3 then has to reconcile N different implementations — wasteful and produces inconsistent code. Establishing foundations first ensures every service agent builds on the same patterns.

**How it works:**

1. Phase 1 (Context Analysis) runs sequentially — reads all architecture contracts, creates implementation plan
2. Phase 2a (Shared Foundations) runs sequentially — establishes `libs/shared/`:
   - Common types/DTOs from OpenAPI schemas
   - Error response format and error classes
   - Logging middleware with correlation IDs
   - Auth middleware template (JWT validation, tenant extraction)
   - Base repository class/pattern
   - Health check pattern
   - Configuration loader from env vars
   - Shared test utilities and fixtures

3. Phase 2b (Service Implementation) runs in parallel — one Agent per service, each reading shared foundations:

```python
# Example: architecture defines user-service, payment-service, notification-service
Agent(
  prompt="You are the Software Engineer. Implement the {service_name} service. "
    "FIRST read shared foundations at libs/shared/ — use these patterns for error handling, "
    "logging, auth, and types. Do NOT create your own versions. "
    "Read API contract at api/openapi/{service}.yaml. "
    "Follow skills/software-engineer/phases/02-service-implementation.md. "
    "Write output to services/{service_name}/.",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  mode="bypassPermissions",
  run_in_background=True  # all services build simultaneously
)
```

4. Wait for all service agents to complete
5. Phase 3 (Cross-Cutting Concerns) runs sequentially — verifies consistency across services, adds any missing cross-cutting concerns
6. Phase 4 (Integration) runs sequentially — wires services together
7. Phase 5 (Local Dev) runs sequentially — docker-compose needs all services

**Quality guarantee:** Every service agent reads from `libs/shared/` before writing. Phase 3 verifies all services use the shared patterns consistently. Inconsistencies are caught and fixed before integration.

**Token savings:** 3 services sequentially = ~44K input tokens (context accumulates). 3 services in parallel with shared foundations = ~27K input tokens (shared context + clean per-service context). Still significantly faster and cheaper than sequential.

**Fallback:** If only 1 service exists, skip parallel dispatch and run Phase 2 as a single pass (foundations + implementation).

## Process Flow

```
Triggered -> Phase 1: Context Analysis -> Implementation Plan
  -> Phase 2a: Shared Foundations (libs/shared — types, errors, middleware, patterns)
  -> Phase 2b: Service Implementation (PARALLEL: 1 Agent per service, each reads shared)
  -> Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Verification (sequential, verify consistency)
  -> Phase 4: Integration Layer (sequential, wires services)
  -> Phase 5: Local Dev Environment -> Suite Complete
```

## Output Contract

| Service implementations | `services/<name>/src/` | Handlers, services, repositories, models, middleware, events, config |
| Service tests | `services/<name>/tests/` | Unit, integration, fixtures |
| Shared libraries | `libs/shared/` | Types, errors, middleware, clients, events, cache, resilience, feature-flags, observability, testing |
| Scripts | `scripts/` | seed-data.sh, dev-setup.sh, migrate.sh |
| Docker Compose | `docker-compose.dev.yml` | Full local dev stack |
| Environment template | `.env.example` | Template for local env vars |
| Root Makefile | `Makefile` | Dev commands: setup, up, down, test, lint, migrate, seed |
| Workspace artifacts | `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/` | implementation-plan.md, progress.md, logs/ |

## Cloud-Specific Patterns

The skill supports AWS (SDK v3, LocalStack), GCP (@google-cloud/*, emulators), Azure (@azure/*, Azurite), and multi-cloud abstractions via provider interfaces selected by `CLOUD_PROVIDER` config.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Business logic in handlers | Handlers validate + delegate. All logic lives in service layer. A handler should be <30 lines. |
| Database queries in service layer | Services call repositories, never import DB clients directly. This breaks testability. |
| Catching and swallowing errors | Use Result types for expected errors. Let unexpected errors bubble to the global error handler. |
| Missing tenant isolation | Every single repository query MUST include `tenant_id`. Add integration tests that verify cross-tenant data is invisible. |
| Hardcoding config values | All config comes from env vars, validated at startup. No magic strings for URLs, timeouts, or feature flags. |
| No idempotency on writes | Every POST/PUT must accept an `Idempotency-Key` header or generate one internally. Duplicate calls return the original response. |
| Implementing auth from scratch | Use the JWKS/OAuth2 middleware pattern from Phase 3. Never parse JWTs with custom code. Use battle-tested libraries. |
| Tests that depend on order | Each test sets up and tears down its own data. Use test fixtures/factories. No shared mutable state. |
| Ignoring graceful shutdown | Register SIGTERM handler. Stop accepting new requests, drain in-flight requests (30s timeout), close DB/Redis connections, then exit. |
| Generating types manually | DTOs come from OpenAPI codegen. Proto types come from protoc. Never hand-write what can be generated. |
| Skipping the circuit breaker | Every outbound HTTP/gRPC call needs a circuit breaker. One slow dependency should not cascade to all services. |
| Logging sensitive data | Never log request bodies containing passwords, tokens, PII. Redact sensitive fields in the logging middleware. |
| Cache without invalidation strategy | Every cache write must have a TTL. Every data mutation must invalidate the relevant cache key. Document the strategy per entity. |
| Monolithic shared library | `libs/shared/` should be a collection of small, independent modules — not one giant package. Each module has its own tests. |
| No `.env.example` | Always commit `.env.example` with placeholder values. Never commit `.env` or `.env.development`. Add to `.gitignore`. |
