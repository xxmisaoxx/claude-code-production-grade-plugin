# Software Engineer

## Overview

Production-grade service implementation engine: reads the Solution Architect's output (`Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/`) and generates fully working service code with business logic, API handlers, data access layers, middleware, and integration patterns. Generates an `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/` folder in the project root containing production-ready service implementations following clean architecture, dependency injection, repository pattern, and cloud-native best practices.

## When to Use

- Implementing services after a Solution Architect has produced `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/`
- Writing API handlers, business logic, and data access layers from API contracts
- Building middleware (auth, logging, rate limiting, caching)
- Creating service-to-service communication and integration layers
- Setting up local development environments with Docker Compose and seed data
- Implementing cross-cutting concerns (retry, circuit breaker, feature flags, multi-tenancy)
- Turning OpenAPI/gRPC/AsyncAPI specs into working service code

## User Experience Protocol

**CRITICAL: Follow these rules for ALL user interactions.**

### RULE 1: NEVER Ask Open-Ended Questions
**NEVER output text expecting the user to type.** Every user interaction MUST use `AskUserQuestion` with predefined options. Users navigate with arrow keys (up/down) and press Enter.

**WRONG:** "What do you think?" / "Do you approve?" / "Any feedback?"
**RIGHT:** Use AskUserQuestion with 2-4 options + "Chat about this" as last option.

### RULE 2: "Chat about this" Always Last
Every `AskUserQuestion` MUST have `"Chat about this"` as the last option — the user's escape hatch for free-form typing.

### RULE 3: Recommended Option First
First option = recommended default with `(Recommended)` suffix.

### RULE 4: Continuous Execution
Work continuously until task complete or user presses ESC. Never ask "should I continue?" — just keep going.

### RULE 5: Real-Time Terminal Updates
Constantly print progress. Never go silent.
```
━━━ [Phase/Task Name] ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⧖ Working on [current step]...
✓ Step completed (details)
✓ Step completed (details)

━━━ Complete ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Summary: [what was produced]
```

### RULE 6: Autonomy
1. Default to sensible choices — minimize questions
2. Self-resolve issues — debug and fix before asking user
3. Report decisions made, don't ask for permission on minor choices
4. Only use AskUserQuestion for major decisions or approval gates

## Pipeline Position

```
Product Manager          Solution Architect          Software Engineer          QA Engineer
    (BRD/PRD)     -->    (Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/)  -->  (Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/)  -->  (Tests/QA)
                         API contracts, schemas,          Working services,             Test suites,
                         ADRs, scaffold                   business logic,               coverage,
                                                          data access                   validation
```

This skill reads from `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/` and produces `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/`. It does NOT redesign the architecture or change API contracts — it implements them faithfully.

## Phase 1: Context Analysis

Read ALL of these from `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/` before writing any code:

### 1.1 — Mandatory Inputs (Fail if Missing)

| Input | Path | What to Extract |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Tech stack | `docs/tech-stack.md` | Language, framework, database, cache, message broker |
| API contracts | `api/openapi/*.yaml` | Endpoints, request/response schemas, auth requirements |
| gRPC contracts | `api/grpc/*.proto` | Service definitions, message types |
| Async contracts | `api/asyncapi/*.yaml` | Event schemas, channels, message formats |
| Data models | `schemas/erd.md` | Entity relationships, field types, constraints |
| Migrations | `schemas/migrations/*.sql` | Table structures, indexes, constraints |
| ADRs | `docs/architecture-decision-records/` | Architecture pattern, communication patterns, data strategy, auth, multi-tenancy |
| Scaffold structure | `scaffold/services/` | Service names, directory layout, existing boilerplate |

### 1.2 — Extract Implementation Decisions

From the ADRs, determine and document:

```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Pattern
- [ ] Monolith / Modular Monolith / Microservices

### Communication
- [ ] REST (OpenAPI) / gRPC / Both
- [ ] Sync vs Async patterns
- [ ] Event bus technology (Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS/Pub-Sub)

### Data Access
- [ ] ORM vs Query Builder vs Raw SQL
- [ ] Connection pooling strategy
- [ ] Read replicas / Write-read split

### Auth Pattern
- [ ] JWT validation / OAuth2 / Session-based
- [ ] RBAC / ABAC / Policy-based
- [ ] Multi-tenancy isolation level (row / schema / database)

### Services to Implement (ordered by dependency)
1. <service-name> — <purpose> — <endpoint count> — <estimated complexity>
2. ...
```

### 1.3 — Clarify Ambiguities

Use AskUserQuestion for anything not covered in the architect's output (batch into 1-2 calls max):

1. **Implementation preferences** — Specific ORM/library preferences? Existing codebase conventions?
2. **Priority ordering** — Which services are MVP-critical vs can-wait?
3. **External service accounts** — Any third-party API keys/SDKs needed? (Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio, etc.)
4. **Feature flag provider** — LaunchDarkly, Unleash, ConfigCat, or env-var based?

**Present the Implementation Plan to user via AskUserQuestion for approval before proceeding.**

## Phase 2: Service Implementation

Implement each service identified in Phase 1, one at a time, in dependency order (shared libs first, then core services, then dependent services).

### 2.1 — Service Structure

Each service in `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/services/<service-name>/` follows clean architecture:

```
services/<service-name>/
├── src/
│   ├── handlers/           # API route handlers (thin — validate, delegate, respond)
│   │   ├── health.ts       # GET /healthz, GET /readyz
│   │   └── <resource>.ts   # CRUD + custom actions per resource
│   ├── services/           # Business logic (pure logic, no framework deps)
│   │   └── <resource>.service.ts
│   ├── repositories/       # Data access (DB queries, cache reads)
│   │   └── <resource>.repository.ts
│   ├── models/             # Domain models and DTOs
│   │   ├── entities/       # Database entity definitions
│   │   ├── dto/            # Request/Response DTOs (from OpenAPI schemas)
│   │   └── mappers/        # Entity <-> DTO transformations
│   ├── middleware/          # Auth, logging, rate limiting, tenant resolution
│   │   ├── auth.middleware.ts
│   │   ├── logging.middleware.ts
│   │   ├── rate-limit.middleware.ts
│   │   ├── tenant.middleware.ts
│   │   └── error-handler.middleware.ts
│   ├── config/             # Service configuration
│   │   ├── index.ts        # Env var loading with validation and defaults
│   │   ├── database.ts     # DB connection config
│   │   └── dependencies.ts # DI container wiring
│   ├── events/             # Event producers and consumers
│   │   ├── producers/
│   │   └── consumers/
│   └── index.ts            # Entry point — bootstrap, graceful shutdown
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/               # Pure logic tests (no I/O)
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── mappers/
│   ├── integration/        # Tests against real DB/cache (testcontainers)
│   │   └── repositories/
│   └── fixtures/           # Shared test data factories
├── Makefile                # build, test, lint, run, migrate
└── package.json / go.mod / requirements.txt / Cargo.toml  # (per language)
```

### 2.2 — Handler Implementation Pattern

Handlers are THIN. They validate input, delegate to services, and format output.

```
Handler receives request
  → Validate request (schema validation from OpenAPI DTOs)
  → Extract tenant context from middleware
  → Call service method with validated DTO
  → Service returns Result<DTO, DomainError>
  → Handler maps to HTTP response (200/201/400/404/500)
  → Structured logging of request/response metadata
```

Required for every handler:
- Request body validation against OpenAPI schema DTOs
- Request ID propagation (from `X-Request-ID` header or generate UUID)
- Structured logging with `trace_id`, `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `method`, `path`, `status`, `duration_ms`
- Error responses in the standard format: `{ code, message, details, trace_id }`
- Pagination support using cursor-based pagination for list endpoints

### 2.3 — Service Layer Implementation Pattern

Services contain ALL business logic. No HTTP awareness, no database awareness.

```
Service method receives validated DTO
  → Apply business rules and validation
  → Call repository for data access
  → Apply domain transformations
  → Emit domain events (if event-driven)
  → Return Result type (not exceptions for expected errors)
```

Required for every service:
- Constructor injection of repositories and dependencies (NO `new` in business logic)
- Domain error types (not HTTP errors — `NotFound`, `Conflict`, `ValidationFailed`, `Unauthorized`)
- Idempotency keys for all write operations
- Audit trail calls for state-changing operations (`who`, `what`, `when`, `tenant`)
- Unit testable in isolation with mocked repositories

### 2.4 — Repository Implementation Pattern

Repositories handle ALL data access. They return domain entities, not raw rows.

```
Repository method receives query parameters
  → Build query with tenant isolation (WHERE tenant_id = ?)
  → Execute with connection pool
  → Map rows to domain entities
  → Handle not-found as explicit return (Option/Maybe), not exception
  → Return domain entities
```

Required for every repository:
- Tenant-scoped queries (every query includes `tenant_id` filter)
- Soft delete support (`deleted_at IS NULL` in all queries)
- Connection pooling with health checks
- Query parameterization (NEVER string concatenation for SQL)
- Optimistic locking via `version` column for concurrent writes
- Read replica routing for read-heavy queries (when configured)

### 2.5 — Dependency Injection Wiring

Every service uses constructor injection. Wire dependencies in `config/dependencies.ts` (or equivalent):

```
// Pseudocode — adapt to chosen DI framework
Container.register({
  // Infrastructure
  dbPool: () => createPool(config.database),
  cache: () => createRedisClient(config.redis),
  eventBus: () => createEventBus(config.messageBroker),

  // Repositories
  userRepository: (c) => new UserRepository(c.dbPool, c.cache),
  orderRepository: (c) => new OrderRepository(c.dbPool, c.cache),

  // Services
  userService: (c) => new UserService(c.userRepository, c.eventBus),
  orderService: (c) => new OrderService(c.orderRepository, c.userService, c.eventBus),

  // Middleware
  authMiddleware: (c) => new AuthMiddleware(c.config.auth),
  tenantMiddleware: (c) => new TenantMiddleware(c.tenantRepository),
});
```

### 2.6 — Language-Specific Standards

#### TypeScript/Node.js
- Strict TypeScript (`strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`)
- ESM modules, no CommonJS
- Zod or class-validator for runtime validation
- Drizzle, Prisma, or TypeORM for data access
- tsx or tsup for compilation
- pino for structured logging
- DI via tsyringe, inversify, or manual constructor injection

#### Go
- Standard library HTTP or Chi/Gin/Fiber router
- sqlx or pgx for database access (not GORM for performance-critical paths)
- Wire or manual DI (no reflection-based DI)
- zerolog or slog for structured logging
- Context propagation for cancellation and tracing
- Table-driven tests

#### Python
- FastAPI or Django REST Framework
- SQLAlchemy or Django ORM
- Pydantic for validation and serialization
- dependency-injector or manual DI
- structlog for structured logging
- pytest with fixtures

#### Rust
- Axum or Actix-web
- SQLx for compile-time checked queries
- Tower middleware
- tracing crate for structured logging
- Manual DI via App state

#### Java/Kotlin
- Spring Boot with constructor injection
- Spring Data JPA or jOOQ
- Spring Security for auth middleware
- SLF4J + Logback for structured logging
- JUnit 5 + Mockito for tests

### 2.7 — Config and Environment Variables

Every service loads config from environment variables with validation at startup:

```
# Required (fail to start if missing)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379
SERVICE_NAME=user-service
ENVIRONMENT=development|staging|production
LOG_LEVEL=debug|info|warn|error
PORT=8080

# Optional (with sensible defaults)
DB_POOL_MIN=2
DB_POOL_MAX=10
DB_QUERY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=300
RATE_LIMIT_RPM=100
GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS=30000

# Feature flags
FEATURE_FLAG_PROVIDER=env|launchdarkly|unleash
FEATURE_NEW_BILLING=false

# Auth
AUTH_JWKS_URL=https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
AUTH_ISSUER=https://auth.example.com
AUTH_AUDIENCE=api.example.com

# Observability
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=${SERVICE_NAME}

# Multi-tenancy
TENANT_ISOLATION_LEVEL=row|schema|database
```

Config must validate at startup and fail fast with clear error messages if required vars are missing.

**After implementing all services, present code to user via AskUserQuestion for review before proceeding.**

## Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns

Implement shared middleware and infrastructure code in `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/libs/shared/` and wire into each service.

### 3.1 — Authentication Middleware

Based on the auth ADR from the architect:

```
Request arrives
  → Extract token (Bearer header / cookie)
  → Validate token (JWT signature, expiry, issuer, audience)
  → Extract claims (user_id, tenant_id, roles, permissions)
  → Attach to request context
  → Pass to next middleware
  → On failure: 401 with standard error format
```

Implementation requirements:
- JWKS key caching with background refresh (not per-request fetch)
- Token introspection fallback for opaque tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) decorator/annotation for handlers
- Permission-based fine-grained access where needed
- Service-to-service auth (mTLS or service account tokens)

### 3.2 — Tenant Resolution Middleware

```
Request arrives (after auth)
  → Extract tenant identifier (from JWT claim / subdomain / header / path)
  → Validate tenant exists and is active
  → Load tenant configuration (feature flags, limits, plan tier)
  → Attach tenant context to request
  → All downstream queries automatically scoped to tenant
  → On failure: 403 with "invalid tenant" error
```

### 3.3 — Error Handling

Global error handler that catches all unhandled errors:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "User with ID '123' not found",
    "details": [],
    "trace_id": "abc-123-def-456"
  }
}
```

Error mapping:
| Domain Error | HTTP Status | Error Code |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| ValidationFailed | 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` |
| Unauthorized | 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` |
| Forbidden | 403 | `FORBIDDEN` |
| NotFound | 404 | `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND` |
| Conflict | 409 | `CONFLICT` |
| RateLimited | 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` |
| InternalError | 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` |
| ServiceUnavailable | 503 | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` |

- Never expose stack traces in production (only in development)
- Always include `trace_id` for support correlation
- Log full error details server-side at ERROR level
- Return user-friendly messages client-side

### 3.4 — Structured Logging

Every log line is JSON with mandatory fields:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "level": "info",
  "service": "user-service",
  "trace_id": "abc-123",
  "span_id": "def-456",
  "tenant_id": "tenant-789",
  "user_id": "user-012",
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/v1/users",
  "status": 201,
  "duration_ms": 45,
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

Log levels:
- `error` — Unexpected failures requiring investigation
- `warn` — Expected failures (validation errors, rate limits, not-found)
- `info` — Request/response lifecycle, business events
- `debug` — Detailed execution flow (disabled in production)

### 3.5 — Rate Limiting

Implement at two levels:

1. **Global rate limiting** (per IP) — Sliding window, configurable RPM per endpoint
2. **Tenant rate limiting** (per tenant) — Based on plan tier from tenant config

```
Request arrives
  → Check global rate limit (Redis INCR + EXPIRE)
  → Check tenant rate limit (Redis INCR + EXPIRE, keyed by tenant_id)
  → If exceeded: 429 with Retry-After header
  → Set response headers: X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset
  → Pass to next middleware
```

### 3.6 — Caching Layer

Implement cache-aside pattern in repositories:

```
Read path:
  → Check cache (Redis) by key
  → Cache HIT: return cached entity, log cache hit
  → Cache MISS: query database, store in cache with TTL, return entity

Write path:
  → Write to database
  → Invalidate cache (delete key, not update — avoids race conditions)
  → Emit cache invalidation event (for multi-instance consistency)
```

Cache key convention: `{service}:{entity}:{tenant_id}:{entity_id}` (e.g., `user-service:user:tenant-123:user-456`)

### 3.7 — Retry and Circuit Breaker

For all external calls (HTTP, database, cache, message broker):

**Retry policy:**
- Max retries: 3
- Backoff: Exponential with jitter (100ms, 200ms, 400ms + random 0-100ms)
- Retry on: Network errors, 502, 503, 504, connection timeouts
- Do NOT retry on: 400, 401, 403, 404, 409 (client errors are not transient)

**Circuit breaker:**
- Closed (normal) → Open (failing) after 5 consecutive failures or >50% error rate in 60s window
- Open → Half-Open after 30s cooldown
- Half-Open → Closed after 3 consecutive successes
- Open state returns 503 immediately (fail fast, don't pile up timeouts)

Use existing libraries: resilience4j (Java), polly (.NET), cockatiel (Node.js), go-resilience (Go), tenacity (Python).

### 3.8 — Feature Flags

Implement a feature flag abstraction that supports multiple backends:

```
interface FeatureFlagService {
  isEnabled(flagName: string, context: { tenantId, userId, environment }): boolean
  getVariant(flagName: string, context): string | null
}
```

Backends:
- **Environment variables** — Simple `FEATURE_X=true/false` (default, zero dependencies)
- **LaunchDarkly / Unleash / ConfigCat** — When dynamic toggling is needed
- **Database-backed** — When tenant-specific flags are needed

Feature flags must be used for:
- New feature rollouts (percentage-based)
- Tenant-specific features (plan tier gating)
- Kill switches for degraded mode
- A/B testing integration points

### 3.9 — Graceful Degradation

Every external dependency must have a fallback:

| Dependency | Degraded Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Cache (Redis) down | Bypass cache, serve from database (higher latency, still functional) |
| Message broker down | Queue events locally (in-memory or disk), replay when reconnected |
| External API down | Return cached/default response, log degradation, alert |
| Read replica down | Route reads to primary (higher load, still functional) |
| Feature flag service down | Fall back to cached flags or env-var defaults |
| Auth service down | Accept cached JWT validation (short window), reject new tokens |

Log all degradation events at WARN level with `degraded_dependency` field.

## Phase 4: Integration Layer

Implement service-to-service communication, event handling, and external API clients.

### 4.1 — Service-to-Service Communication

#### Synchronous (REST/gRPC)

Generate typed HTTP clients for each service-to-service call:

```
// Auto-generated from OpenAPI specs
class UserServiceClient {
  constructor(baseUrl: string, httpClient: HttpClient, circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker)

  async getUser(userId: string, tenantId: string): Promise<Result<UserDTO, ServiceError>>
  async createUser(dto: CreateUserDTO, tenantId: string): Promise<Result<UserDTO, ServiceError>>
}
```

Requirements:
- Generated from OpenAPI/gRPC specs (not hand-written)
- Circuit breaker wrapping all calls
- Request ID propagation (forward `X-Request-ID` from incoming request)
- Tenant context propagation (forward `X-Tenant-ID` header)
- Timeout per call (configurable, default 5s)
- Structured logging of outbound calls

#### Asynchronous (Events)

Generate event producers and consumers from AsyncAPI specs:

**Producer pattern:**
```
Business operation completes
  → Create event envelope: { event_id, event_type, tenant_id, timestamp, payload, correlation_id }
  → Serialize (JSON/Avro/Protobuf per AsyncAPI spec)
  → Publish to topic/queue with retry
  → Log event published at INFO level
```

**Consumer pattern:**
```
Event received from topic/queue
  → Deserialize and validate schema
  → Check idempotency (event_id already processed?)
  → Extract tenant context from event envelope
  → Delegate to event handler service
  → Acknowledge message on success
  → On failure: retry with backoff, then dead-letter queue
  → Log event processed at INFO level
```

Event envelope standard:
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid-v4",
  "event_type": "user.created",
  "event_version": "1.0",
  "source": "user-service",
  "tenant_id": "tenant-123",
  "correlation_id": "trace-abc",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

### 4.2 — External API Clients

For each third-party integration identified in the architecture:

```
Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/libs/shared/clients/
├── stripe/
│   ├── client.ts           # Stripe SDK wrapper with retry/circuit breaker
│   ├── types.ts            # Mapped types (internal domain <-> Stripe types)
│   └── webhooks.ts         # Webhook signature verification + event handlers
├── sendgrid/
│   ├── client.ts
│   └── templates.ts        # Email template mappings
└── <provider>/
    ├── client.ts
    └── types.ts
```

Every external client must:
- Wrap the provider SDK (never use SDK directly in business logic)
- Map provider types to internal domain types
- Include circuit breaker and retry
- Handle webhook verification (if applicable)
- Log all outbound calls with duration and status
- Support mock/stub for testing

### 4.3 — Database Migration Runner

Implement a migration runner that executes the SQL migrations from `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/schemas/migrations/`:

```
migrate up    — Run all pending migrations in order
migrate down  — Rollback last migration
migrate status — Show applied vs pending migrations
```

Requirements:
- Migrations run in a transaction (rollback on failure)
- Migration lock (only one instance runs migrations at a time)
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Logs each migration applied with duration

**After implementing all integration patterns, present to user via AskUserQuestion for review before proceeding.**

## Phase 5: Local Dev Environment

Generate everything needed to run the full stack locally.

### 5.1 — Docker Compose

Generate `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/docker-compose.dev.yml`:

```yaml
# Includes:
# - All application services (with hot-reload/watch mode)
# - PostgreSQL / MySQL (matching production DB)
# - Redis (matching production cache)
# - Message broker (Kafka/RabbitMQ matching production)
# - Mailhog / Mailpit (email testing)
# - LocalStack (if AWS services used) / GCP emulators
# - OpenTelemetry Collector + Jaeger (local tracing)
```

Requirements:
- Health checks on all services (depends_on with condition: service_healthy)
- Named volumes for data persistence across restarts
- Environment variable files (`.env.development`) — NOT committed, `.env.example` committed
- Port mapping that avoids conflicts (document in README)
- Hot-reload enabled for all application services

### 5.2 — Seed Data

Generate `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/scripts/seed-data.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Seeds the local database with realistic test data
# Usage: make seed   (or ./scripts/seed-data.sh)
#
# Creates:
# - 3 tenant organizations (free, pro, enterprise tiers)
# - 10 users per tenant (with various roles)
# - Realistic sample data for each domain entity
# - Admin super-user for testing
```

Requirements:
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times — upserts, not inserts)
- Uses the same migration runner (runs migrations first if needed)
- Creates data that exercises all tenant tiers and role types
- Includes edge cases (long names, unicode, empty optional fields)
- Outputs created credentials and IDs for developer reference

### 5.3 — Dev Setup Script

Generate `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/scripts/dev-setup.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# One-command local development setup
# Usage: ./scripts/dev-setup.sh
#
# Steps:
# 1. Check prerequisites (Docker, language runtime, tools)
# 2. Copy .env.example to .env.development (if not exists)
# 3. Start infrastructure (docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka)
# 4. Wait for services to be healthy
# 5. Run database migrations
# 6. Seed development data
# 7. Install dependencies for all services
# 8. Print "Ready to develop" with service URLs
```

### 5.4 — Makefile

Generate `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/software-engineer/Makefile` (root-level):

```makefile
# Available commands:
# make setup          — First-time dev environment setup
# make up             — Start all services (docker-compose)
# make down           — Stop all services
# make logs           — Tail logs for all services
# make logs-<service> — Tail logs for one service
# make test           — Run all tests
# make test-unit      — Run unit tests only
# make test-int       — Run integration tests only
# make lint           — Lint all services
# make migrate-up     — Run pending migrations
# make migrate-down   — Rollback last migration
# make seed           — Seed development data
# make clean          — Remove containers, volumes, caches
# make build          — Build all service images
```

Per-service Makefiles at `services/<name>/Makefile`:
```makefile
# make run     — Run this service locally (hot-reload)
# make test    — Run this service's tests
# make lint    — Lint this service
# make build   — Build this service
# make migrate — Run this service's migrations
```

## Cloud-Specific Implementation Patterns

### AWS

| Concern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Database | Use AWS SDK v3 for DynamoDB, pg/mysql2 for RDS Aurora |
| Cache | ioredis for ElastiCache, DAX client for DynamoDB caching |
| Messaging | @aws-sdk/client-sqs + @aws-sdk/client-sns |
| Secrets | @aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager with caching (5-min TTL) |
| Storage | @aws-sdk/client-s3 with presigned URLs for uploads |
| Auth | Cognito JWT validation with `aws-jwt-verify` |
| Local dev | LocalStack for S3, SQS, SNS, Secrets Manager, DynamoDB |

### GCP

| Concern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Database | @google-cloud/spanner or pg for Cloud SQL |
| Cache | ioredis for Memorystore |
| Messaging | @google-cloud/pubsub |
| Secrets | @google-cloud/secret-manager with caching |
| Storage | @google-cloud/storage with signed URLs |
| Auth | Firebase Admin SDK or Google Auth Library |
| Local dev | GCP emulators (Pub/Sub, Firestore, Spanner) |

### Azure

| Concern | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Database | @azure/cosmos or mssql for Azure SQL |
| Cache | ioredis for Azure Cache for Redis |
| Messaging | @azure/service-bus |
| Secrets | @azure/keyvault-secrets with caching |
| Storage | @azure/storage-blob with SAS tokens |
| Auth | @azure/identity + MSAL for Azure AD |
| Local dev | Azurite for Blob/Queue/Table storage |

### Multi-Cloud Abstraction

When multi-cloud support is needed, implement provider interfaces:

```
libs/shared/providers/
├── storage.provider.ts         # interface: upload, download, presign
│   ├── s3.storage.ts
│   ├── gcs.storage.ts
│   └── azure-blob.storage.ts
├── messaging.provider.ts       # interface: publish, subscribe, ack
│   ├── sqs.messaging.ts
│   ├── pubsub.messaging.ts
│   └── service-bus.messaging.ts
└── secrets.provider.ts         # interface: get, set, rotate
    ├── aws-sm.secrets.ts
    ├── gcp-sm.secrets.ts
    └── keyvault.secrets.ts
```

Select provider via config: `CLOUD_PROVIDER=aws|gcp|azure`. Wire in DI container.

## Implementation Quality Gates

Before marking a service as complete, verify:

| Gate | Check |
|------|-------|
| Compiles | `make build` passes with zero errors and zero warnings |
| Lint clean | `make lint` passes (ESLint/golangci-lint/ruff/clippy) |
| Unit tests pass | `make test-unit` — all service layer and mapper tests green |
| Integration tests pass | `make test-int` — repository tests against test DB green |
| Health check works | `GET /healthz` returns 200, `GET /readyz` returns 200 when DB connected |
| API contract match | All OpenAPI endpoints implemented, request/response schemas match |
| Tenant isolation | Every query includes `tenant_id` filter — manual review |
| No hardcoded secrets | No API keys, passwords, or tokens in source code |
| Config validation | Service fails fast on startup if required env vars missing |
| Graceful shutdown | SIGTERM triggers connection draining, in-flight request completion |

## Context Bridging from SolutionArchitect-Suite

| Architect Output | Software Engineer Reads | Software Engineer Produces |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| `api/openapi/*.yaml` | Endpoint definitions, schemas | Handlers, DTOs, route registration |
| `api/grpc/*.proto` | Service definitions, messages | gRPC server implementations, generated types |
| `api/asyncapi/*.yaml` | Event schemas, channels | Event producers, consumers, handlers |
| `schemas/migrations/*.sql` | Table structures | Entity models, repository queries |
| `schemas/erd.md` | Relationships, constraints | Mapper logic, validation rules |
| `docs/tech-stack.md` | Language, framework, libraries | Correct imports, idiomatic code |
| `docs/architecture-decision-records/` | Patterns, trade-offs | Pattern-compliant implementation |
| `scaffold/services/` | Service names, structure | Flesh out each service directory |

**Do NOT modify files in `Claude-Production-Grade-Suite/solution-architect/`.** If an API contract needs changes, flag it to the user — do not unilaterally alter the architect's decisions.

## Payment System Integration

For SaaS products, implement payment infrastructure as a core service module (not an afterthought).

### Payment Service Structure
```
services/<payment-service>/
├── src/
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── webhooks.ts          # Stripe/payment webhook handler
│   │   ├── subscriptions.ts     # Subscription CRUD
│   │   └── billing.ts           # Invoice, usage, billing portal
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── payment-provider.ts  # Abstract payment provider interface
│   │   ├── stripe-provider.ts   # Stripe implementation
│   │   ├── subscription.ts      # Subscription lifecycle management
│   │   ├── billing.ts           # Metered billing, usage tracking
│   │   └── entitlements.ts      # Feature gating by plan
│   ├── repositories/
│   │   ├── subscription.ts      # Subscription persistence
│   │   ├── invoice.ts           # Invoice records
│   │   └── usage.ts             # Usage metering records
│   └── models/
│       ├── plan.ts              # Plan definitions (free, pro, enterprise)
│       ├── subscription.ts      # Subscription entity
│       └── invoice.ts           # Invoice entity
└── tests/
```

### Payment Standards
- **Provider abstraction** — Interface over Stripe/Paddle/LemonSqueezy so provider is swappable
- **Webhook idempotency** — Deduplicate by event ID, process exactly once
- **Webhook signature verification** — Always verify Stripe-Signature header
- **Subscription lifecycle** — Handle: created, updated, cancelled, past_due, unpaid, trial_ending
- **Entitlement system** — Feature access tied to plan, not hardcoded. Check `entitlements.canAccess(feature)` in middleware
- **Usage-based billing** — Track metered usage, report to billing provider, aggregate hourly
- **Invoice management** — Store invoice copies locally for compliance
- **Dunning flow** — Grace period → email reminders → downgrade → suspension
- **Tax handling** — Use Stripe Tax or TaxJar for automatic tax calculation
- **Multi-currency** — Support if serving international users
- **PCI compliance** — Never store card details. Use Stripe Elements / Checkout Sessions.
- **Billing portal** — Integrate Stripe Customer Portal or build custom

### Plan & Entitlement Configuration
```yaml
plans:
  free:
    price: 0
    features: [basic_feature]
    limits:
      api_calls: 100/day
      storage: 1GB
  pro:
    price: 29/month
    features: [basic_feature, advanced_feature, priority_support]
    limits:
      api_calls: 10000/day
      storage: 100GB
  enterprise:
    price: custom
    features: [all]
    limits:
      api_calls: unlimited
      storage: unlimited
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Business logic in handlers | Handlers validate + delegate. All logic lives in service layer. A handler should be <30 lines. |
| Database queries in service layer | Services call repositories, never import DB clients directly. This breaks testability. |
| Catching and swallowing errors | Use Result types for expected errors. Let unexpected errors bubble to the global error handler. |
| Missing tenant isolation | Every single repository query MUST include `tenant_id`. Add integration tests that verify cross-tenant data is invisible. |
| Hardcoding config values | All config comes from env vars, validated at startup. No magic strings for URLs, timeouts, or feature flags. |
| No idempotency on writes | Every POST/PUT must accept an `Idempotency-Key` header or generate one internally. Duplicate calls return the original response. |
| Implementing auth from scratch | Use the JWKS/OAuth2 middleware pattern from Phase 3. Never parse JWTs with custom code. Use battle-tested libraries. |
| Tests that depend on order | Each test sets up and tears down its own data. Use test fixtures/factories. No shared mutable state. |
| Ignoring graceful shutdown | Register SIGTERM handler. Stop accepting new requests, drain in-flight requests (30s timeout), close DB/Redis connections, then exit. |
| Generating types manually | DTOs come from OpenAPI codegen. Proto types come from protoc. Never hand-write what can be generated. |
| Skipping the circuit breaker | Every outbound HTTP/gRPC call needs a circuit breaker. One slow dependency should not cascade to all services. |
| Logging sensitive data | Never log request bodies containing passwords, tokens, PII. Redact sensitive fields in the logging middleware. |
| Cache without invalidation strategy | Every cache write must have a TTL. Every data mutation must invalidate the relevant cache key. Document the strategy per entity. |
| Monolithic shared library | `libs/shared/` should be a collection of small, independent modules — not one giant package. Each module has its own tests. |
| No `.env.example` | Always commit `.env.example` with placeholder values. Never commit `.env` or `.env.development`. Add to `.gitignore`. |
